A simple heuristic based approach to map an emailID to its probable user's name by using minimum editDistance.
The function takes a list of emailIDs as first argument and a list of probable names as second argument.
The return value is a dictionary having emailID as key and the mapped name as the value
The function works best when the list of names has more entries than list of emailIDs
